          The last step would be the digitization of the drawings. A
          professional studio camera or scanner is used to digitize the
          drawings. You have to take care of the light, that everything is
          digitized in the same way. Each drawing must be digitized! bases,
          accessories, labels, plugs, backgrounds, etc
